  </div>
  <div class="written-section1">
    <p class="write-s-1">Spitz sunflower seeds have always had the same type of packaging: an easy tear plastic bag. They advertise their bags as the perfect snack solution for those who are on the go and a bag that is hassle free and easy to throw away. However, their current sunflower seed bag is made of a plastic material that is not biodegradable or eco-friendly.</p>
    <p class="write-s-2">I focused on providing a solution to this issue while staying true to the brand's look and feel, using different colours to indicate the various flavours, and provide a useful yet playful look to the box itself. The box features a window that is not only used by customers to see the product they will be purchasing, but doubles as an image of a sunflower when paired with the petal illustrations on the box.</p>
  </div>
  <figure class="fig1">

    <figcaption>Spitz Sunflower Seeds have always been easily recognizable through their use of bright and playful colours. They use these colours in a way that is unique to their company and practical as an indicator for variation in their flavours. I wanted to stay true to the Spitz Sunflower Seed brand and use these bright and bold colours in a recognizable way.</figcaption>

    <img class="fig-img" src="http://placehold.it/900x600" alt="">
    <figcaption>I also wanted to provide consumers with a choice of flavours for their sunflower seeds. Spitz Sunflower Seeds prides themselves in their wide range of flavours, so I designed a large box seeming fairly similar to Spitz Sunflower Seeds' previous look; however, inside I made six separate smaller slip cover boxes, each containing a different flavour.</figcaption>

  </div>
  <p class="closing">Not only is the package redesign playful and fun, but it also maintains a high level of practicality. Each small container has a slip cover that when removed, becomes an accessible tray for the sunflower seeds.</p>
