    <div class="written-section1">
      <p class="write-s-1">Pho Moonlight offers the finest Vietnamese style cuisine in Kanata and promises each and every one of their customers satisfaction; but while they may serve only the highest quality food, their logo sends their customers a different message. Due to the current logo design, Pho Moonlight is perceived as out of date and low quality. At first glance, their logo does not demonstrate just what they have to offer.</p>
      <p class="write-s-2">I chose to redesign their overall look and brand, providing them with an image that would demonstrate Pho Moonlight’s professionalism and would communicate their welcoming, friendly and comfortable atmosphere. We bring this all together through the unique and stylish logo design combining a modern visual representation of their delicious cuisine. We reflect Pho Moonlight’s own unique style and identity with the suggestion of a crescent moon found in the positive space.</p>

      <img class="fig-img" src="http://placehold.it/900x600" alt="">
      <figcaption>While the dish “Pho” has become known around Ottawa, Pho Moonlight’s current logo has no indication as to what they serve. I wanted to make an understandable image for people who may not know what Pho is or customers who may be passing by. To improve upon this, I created a more up to date design that tells the customer right away what Pho Moonlight has to offer. I wanted to give them a more professional and well put together graphic for their logo.</figcaption>

    <figure class="fig2">
      <img class="fig-img" src="http://placehold.it/900x600" alt="">
      <figcaption>I wanted to make a very clean and simple style graphic that could easily be recognized. In this graphic I used the image of a chopstick, three noodles and a bowl, all created from the negative space of a circle. These items all together can easily be recognized as Pho noodle soup. By using the negative space to create this image, it also allowed me to play with the positive space, creating points near the bottom of the circle, where the bowl cuts off, giving the illusion of a crescent moon shape.</figcaption>

    <p class="closing">Along with a redesign of their logo, we enhanced their overall brand, emphasizing their welcoming and friendly atmosphere through their new modern image. A branding guide was developed, paired with the logo helping to ensure only the best design decisions and guiding them to an overall more professional image.</p>
