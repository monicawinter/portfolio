    <p class="write-s-1">I created a patterned illustration to make a graphic style octopus t-shirt. The octopus is made up of varying sizes of lines and different patterns.</p>
    <p class="write-s-2">The t-shirt was designed to have the illustration wrap around from the front to the back of the shirt seamlessly.</p>
