      <p itemprop="text" class="write-s-1">These posters were designed as a way to display and advertise my own personal font creation, titled CheeryOhs. The CheeryOhs font was designed originally to be based loosely on a handwritten-style font. The more free flowing curves and thick to thin style strokes of each letter were designed to give the font a natural and playful feel.</p>
      <p itemprop="text" class="write-s-2">In the posters, certain features that make the font unique, were chosen to be highlighted and emphasized through the imagery and information described on the poster. Each poster displays a variety of letters matching the featured demonstrated in the designated poster, and explains what makes the font unique and successful.</p>

      <figcaption itemprop="text">Angled curves and diagonal stress were applied to the bowls and shoulders of each letter in the CheeryOhs font. The strong contrast of stroke weights throughout the letters are emphasized and supported by these exaggerated curves.</figcaption>

    <p itemprop="text" class="closing">CheeryOhs is a very playful and lively font emphasized through its dramatic angled curves and variation in stroke weight. With the combination of the font’s pointed and angled edges, diagonal stress, and its thick horizontal finials, CheeryOhs achieves the goal of creating a fun and unique display type font.</p>

    <div class="written-section1">
      <p itemprop="text" class="write-s-1">One of the best ways for a company to build a positive reputation and strong image in the eyes of the public, their employees, and potential business partners is by publishing an annual report. Yet when it comes to the design of this information, it seems most companies have not yet explored their options and have not yet attempted to bring these types of booklets to their full design potential.</p>
      <p itemprop="text" class="write-s-2">It is for this reason that I decided to redesign CHEO’s annual report booklet in a way that allows its reader to stay a bit more interested and follow through the information in an easier and more organized fashion.</p>

      <img itemprop="image" class="fig-img" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/cheo-sketch1.jpg" alt="">
      <figcaption itemprop="text">CHEO is already unique in the way that it focuses on providing care for sick children under the age of 18, as well as providing a source of medical education for those training to help patients such as those found at CHEO. For this reason I wanted to keep things playful but still maintain a certain level of professionalism. Keeping this in mind, I focused on an illustrative based concept.</figcaption>

      <img itemprop="image" class="fig-img" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/cheo-sketch2.jpg" alt="">
      <figcaption itemprop="text">All illustrations throughout the booklet are medical related with images of hospital equipment, research tools, or people you would see working at the hospital. I introduce this illustrative concept right from the beginning as I used faded illustrated icons on the front and back covers, not only to show different hospital related symbols or to create visual interest, but also to introduce the different sections of the booklet to the reader. These icons are then placed throughout the booklet as dividers for each section and to help mark on each page in the top corners where the reader is in the booklet.</figcaption>

    <p itemprop="text" class="closing">Annual reports, especially those presented in Canada, often face another issue of the inclusion of multiple language layouts. The use of colour throughout the report, help to differentiate between the french and english sides of the report, and separate the information from the left side to the right.</p>

    <div class="written-section1">
      <p itemprop="text" class="write-s-1">One of the most well known horror movies when it comes to ghosts and supernatural events, is the movie Poltergeist. Recently, in 2015, a remake of the original classic was made, so I decided to remake my own version of the Poltergeist movie poster.</p>
      <p itemprop="text" class="write-s-2">I chose to recreate to iconic image of a ghostly spirit, or poltergeist, emerging from an old static image TV screen, but from a different angle. I wanted to put the viewer in the shoes of the characters, making it seem almost as though the spirit was emerging from the poster itself.</p>

      <figcaption itemprop="text">One element that I felt was important to maintain was the classic Poltergeist title logo. By pairing the glowing text with the texture of a static television screen, it communicates a very important and popular scene of the movie without revealing too many details.</figcaption>

    <div class="written-section1">
      <p itemprop="text" class="write-s-1">Horror movies have a certain type of feel when it comes to their poster designs. Whether it’s through the images shown or the colour they’re made with, a certain mood comes to mind when you hear the word “horror.” For this particular project, I wanted to change the normal look you may see when it comes to horror.</p>
      <p itemprop="text" class="write-s-2">This Haunted Horror Night event, does not provide a specific horror movie title that will be screened; rather they play an array of movies in the one night. For this reason, I did an illustrative style helping to maintain the mystery behind what movie may be screened. Whether it is an old or new movie, ghost or zombie, the image simply sets the mood of the Haunted Horror Night.</p>

      <figcaption itemprop="text">The colour variations were taken from different horror poster themes. Typically we are presented with a lot of reds and darker blacks to represent darkness and gore. However I chose to explore some further colour options.</figcaption>

      <img itemprop="image" class="fig-img" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/haunted-bw.jpg" alt="">
      <figcaption itemprop="text">I experimented with colours such as different shades of blues or different shades of orange; each colour option, changing the entire mood of the poster. Depending on the theme of movies chosen for that night, many of these colour combinations could provide an excellent hint to the viewers hoping to attend.</figcaption>
