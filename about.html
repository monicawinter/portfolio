    <h1 class="about-h1">Hello!</h1>
    <p class="about-p">Hi there! Let me tell you a little bit about myself. I am a passionate and dedicated designer who loves all kinds of art; be it music, dance, or most of all visual arts. I have always been involved in art from a very young age, starting with pencil illustrations and acrylic painting. I love to create new and exciting projects that no one has seen before and push myself to explore fresh ideas.</p>
