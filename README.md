Throughout my life, I have always been surrounded by art. Both my grandfather and mom have a deep passion for art but they never pursued it. I loved when they would share their art with me, which ultimately inspired me to exploring my own creative side, and ultimately pushed me to share my art with others. I take every opportunity I can to create my own memorable pieces and hope to one day inspire someone as my grandfather and mom have for me.
