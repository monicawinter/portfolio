    <h2 itemprop="name" class="work-sectionsh2">Don't Blink</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="written-section1">
    <p itemprop="text" class="write-s-1">Based around the Doctor Who episode “Blink”, this video was created as a title sequence for a potential horror movie. To provide a little background, this particular episode features a creature called the weeping angel. The weeping angels are meant to be a race of predatory creatures, resembling stone statues. When they are not being observed by another being, they can move very quickly and silently, allowing them to close long distances in only the blink of an eye.</p>
    <p itemprop="text" class="write-s-2">With this plot line throughout the show’s episode, it makes for a unique and suspenseful situation. A glitch type effect along with television static was applied throughout the video, in both the footage and type itself. This was used as it further relates back to the original Doctor Who episode, as the Doctor attempts to warn those in danger through an old television on an old and “glitchy” tape.</p>

  </div>
  <p itemprop="text" class="closing-2">The combination of carefully chosen sound effects, along with the idea of bringing the viewer into complete darkness, enhances the suspenseful effect, and carries through the horror style throughout the rest of the video up until the final reveal of the angel.</p>
